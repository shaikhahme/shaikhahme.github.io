    <h2>Humble(?) Beginings</h2>
    <p>
    <strong> Ever wondered what happens when someone who loves learning and has a strong commitment to society (dodged the corporate supervillian timeline), stumbles upon engineering and psychology?</strong>
    </p>

        Apparently, you get someone like me!
        <br>A passionate cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong interest in Defensive Security. <br>Following that path I also found myself interested in Information Security Management, Application Security, Network Security, USEC and most importantly Social Engineering!
        <br>

        <br>
        I knew Cybersecurity was my calling when I discovered it is the perfect intersection between all my major interests: engineering, psychology, and a personal responsibility to contribute to society. In all honesty, the personal responsibility came later, I spent my young teen years learning how to hack WIFIs, Games and social media accounts. However, since then I have matured, made a promise to use my skills for others and have been on an incredible journey of learning and growth both in the fields and personally.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Professional Growth:</strong> Currently, I’m part of the cybersecurity department at Cumulocity IoT, specifically with ISM and DevSecOps. Here I contribute to strengthening the security posture by implementing policies as code.
        <br>
        <strong>Research & Academia:</strong> My journey also led me to the city of lights, Paris, where I conducted research in Cyber Threat Intelligence and published my first academic paper in the IEEE journal. This milestone allowed me to present at the prestigious IWCMC 2024 by IEEE conference in Cyprus.
        <br>
        <strong>Leadership & Community:</strong> As a student council head and vice chair for two years, I honed my soft skills—cross-cultural communication, leadership, and collaboration—while giving back to my community.

    <h2>Knowledge Base</h2>
    <p>This section is dedicated to my knowledge base. The aim is to track all of gained knowledge and to use it to fine tune an LLM. As of now you can see some topics of my knowledge and if you right click you'll see a short desc of the topic. However this is a simple a place-holder while I work on the actual project</p>
